            <p>
                AI-generated images are popping up more and more in game development, especially in the early stages.
                Studios use them for things like concept art, placeholder textures, or quick visual mockups—basically
                to get ideas on screen fast before real artists come in and do the final work. From a production
                standpoint, that speed can be genuinely helpful.
            </p>

            <p>
                But this is where things get tricky. Recent backlash around games like <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>
                shows how fast things can go sideways. Even if AI art is only used temporarily, players tend to feel
                blindsided when developers aren’t upfront about it. There’s a growing fear that AI is quietly replacing
                human creativity—or being trained on artists’ work without consent.
            </p>

            <p>
                The real issue isn’t “AI bad, humans good.” It’s about how AI is used and how honest developers are
                about it. When AI supports artists and studios are transparent, most players seem willing to shrug
                and move on. But when it feels hidden or like a shortcut around creative labor, trust disappears
                almost instantly.
            </p>

            <p>
                That’s why AI-generated imagery has become such a big ethical conversation in modern game development.
                It’s not just about technology—it’s about respect, transparency, and keeping players in the loop.

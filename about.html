        <h2>About This Newsletter</h2>
        <p>
            <em>The Render Queue</em> covers how AI-generated graphics and art are being used in video game
            development. This includes concept art, textures, placeholder assets, and the growing debate
            around AI use in creative pipelines.
        </p>

        <p>
            The focus is on applied, real-world usage—what studios are experimenting with, what tools are
            actually being used, and how players and artists are responding.
        </p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Cody, and I’m a student in CAH 205: Applied AI. I’m interested in how AI tools intersect
            with game development, especially where they clash with creative labor and player expectations.

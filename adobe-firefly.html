            <h2>Adobe Firefly Pushes “Ethical AI” Into Game Development</h2>
            <p>Adobe Firefly has become a tool for commercial creative work, including video game development. Unlike many open-source AI art tools, Firefly is trained on licensed and public-domain content, reducing copyright and ethical concerns (Adobe, 2024).</p>
            <p>Integrated into Photoshop and Illustrator, Firefly offers Generative Fill and text-to-image tools. It also provides content credentials, allowing developers to disclose when AI-assisted art is used. For studios, Firefly provides a safer way to experiment with AI without risking backlash or legal issues.</p>

            <h3>Why it matters:</h3>
            <p>AI-assisted workflows like Firefly allow experimentation without compromising ethics, but player skepticism remains. Ethical training data doesn’t fully address concerns about human creativity or authorship.</p>

            <h3>My perspective:</h3>
            <p>Firefly is a compromise: AI supports artists rather than replacing them. Acceptance by players will shape the future of AI in game development.</p>

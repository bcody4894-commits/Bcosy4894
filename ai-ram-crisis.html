            <h2>AI and the RAM Crisis in Video Games</h2>
            <p class="date">February 2026</p>

            <p>
                One of the less visible impacts of AI in video games is how much system memory it consumes.
                As developers add more advanced AI systems, RAM usage has become a growing concern behind
                the scenes (Gregory, 2018).
            </p>

            <p>
                Modern AI-driven behaviors often rely on large behavior trees, real-time data tracking,
                and continuous decision-making. Unlike traditional scripted NPC logic, these systems stay
                active throughout gameplay, quietly competing for memory with textures, physics, audio,
                and world streaming (Millington &amp; Funge, 2016).
            </p>

            <p>
                This becomes especially noticeable on consoles and lower-end PCs, where memory budgets are
                fixed. When AI systems push those limits, players may experience stuttering, longer load
                times, or reduced visual quality as engines dynamically reallocate memory to maintain
                performance (NVIDIA Developer Blog, 2023).
            </p>

            <p>
                To avoid these issues, studios often scale back AI complexity or limit where advanced AI is
                used. Some developers combine AI-driven systems with simpler scripted logic to reduce
                memory overhead while preserving believable behavior (Gregory, 2018).
            </p>

            <p>
                As AI continues to evolve, memory management is becoming just as important as AI design
                itself. How developers balance smarter systems with hardware limitations will play a major
                role in whether AI enhances gameplay—or quietly creates new performance problems.

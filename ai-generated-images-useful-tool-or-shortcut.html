                AI-generated images are popping up more and more in game development, especially in the early
                stages. Studios use them for things like concept art, placeholder textures, or quick visual
                mockups—basically to get ideas on screen fast before real artists come in and do the final work.
                From a production standpoint, that speed can be extremely helpful.
            </p>

            <p>
                But this is where things get tricky. Recent backlash around games like
                <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> shows how quickly things can go sideways. Even when AI art
                is only used temporarily, players often feel blindsided when developers are not upfront about
                it. There is a growing fear that AI is quietly replacing human creativity—or worse, being trained
                on artists’ work without consent.
            </p>

            <p>
                The real issue is not simply “AI bad, humans good.” It is about how AI is used and how honest
                developers are about that use. When AI supports artists and studios are transparent, many players
                seem willing to accept it. When it feels hidden or like a shortcut around creative labor, trust
                disappears almost instantly.
            </p>

            <p>
                That is why AI-generated imagery has become such a major ethical conversation in modern game
                development. The debate is not just about technology—it is about respect, transparency, and
                keeping players informed.

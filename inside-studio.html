            <h2>Inside the Studio: A Journalist Investigates AI in Game Development</h2>
            <p>I spent a week observing a mid-sized indie studio to see AI in action. Developers used Midjourney and DALL·E in pre-production to explore lighting, composition, and mood. None of these AI-generated images appeared in the final game; human artists recreated or refined every asset.</p>
            <p>A lead artist told me, “It’s like a sketchbook on steroids.” The workflow allowed faster iteration and exploration of ideas while keeping final designs entirely human-made. Yet internal debates about ethics, copyright, and potential player reactions were ongoing.</p>

            <h3>Why it matters:</h3>
            <p>This firsthand look shows that AI can support creativity without replacing artists, but assumptions about “handcrafted” art remain strong among players. Miscommunication about AI’s role risks unnecessary backlash.</p>

            <h3>My perspective:</h3>
            <p>AI isn’t the villain—it’s misunderstanding. Transparency about AI’s function can maintain trust while still leveraging its benefits.</p>
